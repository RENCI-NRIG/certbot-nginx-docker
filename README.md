# Certbot / Nginx / Docker

### What’s Certbot?

Certbot is a free, open source software tool for automatically using [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate on manually-administrated websites to enable HTTPS.

Certbot is made by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/), a 501(c)3 nonprofit based in San Francisco, CA, that defends digital privacy, free speech, and innovation.

This project uses the `--webroot` method of [certificate issuance](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#webroot).

**NOTE**: All included scripts are runnable by non-sudo users (assuming the user is in the `docker` group). The generated output files will however be owned by the `root` user, and as such would require `sudo` level rights to move or manipulate.

## <a name="tldr"></a>TL;DR

Assumes that Docker is installed, and that you have `sudo` rights on the machine you wish to install certificate on.

### Generate initial certificate

Create a `.env` file from `env.template`, then run:

```
./letsencrypt-init.sh
```

and follow the prompts

### Renew existing certificate

Update the `.env` file if needed, then run:

```
./letsencrypt-renew.sh
```
and follow the prompts

## Detailed Overview

### <a name="env"></a>Configuration file: `.env`

Example values are provided in `env.template`, but your `.env` file should be updated to match host and configuration requirements for your deployment.

```bash
# Environment variable declaration

# Domain(s) you wish to get a certificate for
DOMAINS=(example.org www.example.org)

# RSA key size
RSA_KEY_SIZE=4096

# Adding a valid address is strongly recommended
EMAIL=''

# Staging a dry-run - enabled = 1, disabled = 0 (ref: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/)
STAGING=1

# Volumes on host denoted as full path
# Path to certificate and chain, key file and certbot maintenance files
CERTS=/home/username/certbot/certs
# Path to http-01 challenge files
CERTS_DATA=/home/username/certbot/data

# SELinux - enforced = 1, disabled = 0
SELINUX=0

# Ports for http and https
HTTP_PORT=80
HTTPS_PORT=443
```

**NOTE**: it is recommended to start with `STAGING=1` until you receive the success message (see below) as too many failed attempts can get you blocked.

```console
...
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - The dry run was successful.
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
```

### <a name="init"></a>Generate initial certificate script: `letsencrypt-init.sh`

This script should be used when first acquiring your initial Let's Encrypt certificate.

Update the `.env` file to suit your environment. It is recommended to start with `STAGING=1` (example using hostname [dp-dev-1.cyberimpact.us]())

First dry-run with `STAGING=1`:

```console
$ ./;
INFO: source environment variables

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/dp-dev-1.cyberimpact.us/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/dp-dev-1.cyberimpact.us/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2019-10-13. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
   again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.

This script should be used when renewing your existing Let's Encrypt certificate and the well-known endpoint is already exposed via the web server.

Only the `certbot` container is run so that certificate can be updated without having to stop/start the web server.

```console
$ ./letsencrypt-renew-alt.sh

## <a name="cert-files"></a>Certificate files

Certbot will create a number of files, including your certificate in the directory defined by the `CERTS` variable. These files will be owned by the `root` user, and care should be taken as their order is important for Certbot when renewing your certificate.

Review the information at: `/home/username/certbot/certs/live/README`

```
This directory contains your keys and certificates.

`[cert name]/privkey.pem`  : the private key for your certificate.
`[cert name]/fullchain.pem`: the certificate file used in most server software.
`[cert name]/chain.pem`    : used for OCSP stapling in Nginx >=1.3.7.
`[cert name]/cert.pem`     : will break many server configurations, and should not be used
                 without reading further documentation (see link below).

WARNING: DO NOT MOVE OR RENAME THESE FILES!
         Certbot expects these files to remain in this location in order
         to function properly!

We recommend not moving these files. For more information, see the Certbot
User Guide at https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#where-are-my-certificates.
```

Example from [dp-dev-1.cyberimpact.us](): `/home/username/certbot/certs`

Requires `sudo` rights due to `root` ownership:

```console
$ sudo ls -alh /home/username/certbot/certs/
...
drwx------ 4 root    root   84 Jul 15 10:24 accounts
drwx------ 3 root    root   36 Jul 15 10:25 archive
drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root   33 Jul 15 10:24 csr
drwx------ 2 root    root   33 Jul 15 10:24 keys
